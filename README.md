Halver
======

Halver is a utility for OS X, designed for use with HiDPI displays such as the MacBook Pro with Retina display.

**The problem:** You have a Retina display, and you take a screenshot. It looks fabulous on your computer, but enormous in Campfire, on the web, and on anyone else's computer.

**The solution:** Halver watches your desktop. Any time a new screenshot appears, it automatically replaces it with two new screenshots:

* A half-resolution PNG
* A full-resolution JPEG, encoded at 80%

Now you're free to share the PNG screenshot without annoying your friends and neighbors. And the full-size screenshot is there too, but now in a reasonable file size.

Requirements
------------

Halver requires OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion).

A Retina display isn't actually required, although you'll end up with tiny screenshots if you use it on a non-HiDPI display. Which might be what you're going for; if so, knock yourself out.

Coded and compiled in Xcode 4.5 DP3. I dunno, it might work in 4.4, but that's left as an exercise for the reader.

Add Halver to your login items, to make sure it sticks around on the next launch.
